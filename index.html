                Dear graduates of the class of 2022, 
When a couple of weeks ago I was asked to address you today I can’t hide that I felt privileged and proud. It’s an honor for me to stand here today in front of you and I would like to thank the faculty and our university for granting me this opportunity. 
I was given clear instructions that my speech should take between 5 and 8 minutes. I would not be true to myself if I would follow these instructions to the letter and I am pretty sure that nobody expected that either. In life it’s important to always do a little more than what’s expected. I love numbers and have a weakness for the number 3 so I will do my utmost best to talk 3 times 3 minutes. 
<br><br>
While you all have clearly proven above average intelligence the next steps in your personal and professional development are as important as that piece of paper you earned.
Much is written about the younger generation and much more will be written about the next. For me there is no such thing as generation x, y, z. Beside the fact that a generation is born around the same time, every generation is a group of individuals. Each with their own dreams and personalities. Their own desires and flaws. Their own challenges and disappointments. The average is not always the mean; there is still the standard deviation. Deviate and stand out. 
            </p>
